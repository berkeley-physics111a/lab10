Important objects:
    ADSHardware (class): a collection of methods for interfacing with the ADS
        variables:
            handle: address to connect to the ADS
        functions:
            startup: connects to ADS
            open_scope: opens connection to oscilloscope
            trigger_scope: sets trigger level for scope (buggy)
            read_scope: collects data from oscilloscope
            close_scope: closes connection to oscilloscope
            use_wavegen: outputs function at wavegen
            close_wavegen: closes connection to wavegen
            disconnect: closes connection to ADS
    oscilloscope_run (function): opens connection to and collects data from scope
    fft (function): returns a fast fourier transform of input data
    demodulate (function): not implemented
    snr (function): not implemented
    wavegen_functions (dict): easy names to access major types of functions wavegen can output
